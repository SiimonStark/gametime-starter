## Project title
**Jeopardy: GameTime**

Created by:
 - Raechel Odom (https://github.com/raechelo) 
 - Justin Pyktel (https://github.com/SiimonStark)

## How it works:
 - Similar to the hit TV show that swept the nation, starting back in the '60s. We give you the question first, and you have to answer the question _perfectly_! Three contestants battle head to head for bragging rights!
 
### Game Instructrions:
 - Choose your favorite starter Pokemon, and if you'd like you can rename it by clicking on their name.
 - Press Start. You'll see the categories and your selected names display on the board.
 - Choose any point value and category you'd like, and take your best shot at solving the question. (I'll warn you, it gets a bit challenging)
 
### Installation:
 - Pull down our repo to your local machine
 - If you haven't already, pullup your Terminal
 - Run:  **_npm install_**  to download all of the user/devdependencies
 - Run:  **_npm install jQuery --save_**  to download the jQuery Libbrary
 - Run:  **_npm start_**  to start our webpack server
 - Open:  http://localhost:8080/?   or whatever your port number has been changed too (port = 8080).
 - **Play!!**

###Work-Flow:
 - We used Waffle.io integration with Github to make sure we stayed on track
 - As well as Slack for team communication
 - In the short 2 weeks we tried to maintian an Agile workflow, to test our features

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: 

Biggest win: 
 - Once we got the Webpack and our datasets communicating, it was relatively smooth sailing!

Challenges and places for improvement:
 - Webpack was a first, and also having to write so many of our tests.
 - I hope to revisit this project in the future to refactor and add features that we couldn't get to in the time alotted.

## Credits:
 Also thank you to everyone who donated their time and patience to our success. Turing truly is a great environment to start this journey into our tech careers! The ecosystem of other developers all struggling and learning together builds such a strong emphasis on helping others and yourself to achieve success!!!
