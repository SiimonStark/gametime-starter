## Project title
**Jeopardy: GameTime**

Created by:
 - Raechel Odom (https://github.com/raechelo) 
 - Justin Pyktel (https://github.com/SiimonStark)

## How it works:
 - Similar to the hit TV show that swept the nation, starting back in the '60s. We give you the question first, and you have to answer the question _perfectly_! Three contestants battle head to head for bragging rights!
### Game Instructrions:
 - Choose your favorite starter Pokemon, and if you'd like you can rename it by clicking on their name.
 - Press Start. You'll see the categories and your selected names display on the board.
 - Choose any point value and category you'd like, and take your best shot at solving the question. (I'll warn you, it gets a bit challenging)
 
### Installation:
 - Pull down our repo to your local machine
 - If you haven't already, pullup your Terminal
 - Run:  _npm install_**  to download all of the user/devdependencies
 - Run:  **_npm install jQuery --save_**  to download the jQuery Libbrary
 - Run:  -npm start  to start our webpack server
 - Open:  http://localhost:8080/?   or whatever your port number has been changed too (port = 8080).
 - Play!!

####Work-Flow:
 - We used Waffle.io integration with Github to make sure we stayed on track
 - As well as Slack for team communication
